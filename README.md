# Signalsim - SIGNAL SIMULATOR

A very cool browsergame I've built to play around with gates and other elements!

Built with ðŸ’– by Stein for SIEGE / Hack Club.

## What is SIGNALSIM?

Signalsim (signal simulator) lets you experiment with fundamental digital logic. Drag nodes onto the canvas, connect them with wires, and build amazing stuff!

Itâ€™s great for learning and having fun!

## Features

- Realâ€‘time signal and visual feedback
- Lightweight, runs locally in your browser (no install!!!)
- A library of logic and utility nodes to compose complex behavior (since you can't combine any circuits!)

## Node library

Each node has inputs/outputs you can wire together. Current builtâ€‘ins include:

- Input: A manual value source (often -n to n)
- Button: A button to emit a pulse
- Clock: Periodic source that emits ticks at a fixed interval (in ms)
- Inverter: Outputs the opposite of its input
- AND: Outputs 1 when all inputs are 1
- OR: Outputs 1 when any input is 1
- XOR: Outputs 1 when an odd number of inputs are 1
- Adder: Adds numeric inputs
- Subtractor: Subtracts one numeric input from another
- Binary Encoder: Converts int inputs into a binary code
- Binary Decoder: Converts a binary code into int outputs
- Display: Shows a numeric value for easy view
- Light: Visual indicator that turns on when signal is 1 or higher
- Node: Was just a testing node at first

## Controls

- Drag to move nodes, click ports to start a wire to a destination port to connect
